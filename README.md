# Word Ladder
The goal of this project is to create a word ladder between two five-letter words. A word ladder is a list of words from a start word to an end word where each word inbetween differs by only one letter.

Ex. A word ladder for "brain" and "smart" would be:  
brain  
blain  
slain  
stain  
staid  
stand  
stank  
stark  
start  
smart 

## Getting Started
There are a few prerequisites before using this project.
* Download and set up a c++ compiler (MinGW)
* Either clone this repository in your development environment or simply download the zip file
* Compile each .cpp file (g++ main.cpp WordLadder.cpp)
* run the executable

You now will be prompted to enter 2 words. Assuming that each word is found in the "dictionary" and that each word is exactly five-letters, the word ladder will be computed and stored in a text file called ladder.txt. The text file will contain the string "No Word Ladder Found." if there is no word ladder between the two correctly inputted words.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome in expanding the dictionary. If you would like to contribute please follow these steps
* Clone this repository into your development environment
* Create a new branch and make any changes to the dictionary
* Push the new branch to Github
* Create a pull request to merge this branch into the master branch
